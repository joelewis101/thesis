### Malawi

Malawi is a country of 17.5 million people in South-Eastern Africa (2018 Census, Malawi national statistical office). It is one of the poorest countries in the world: it is a low income country under the World Bank classifcation, with a 2017 Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of \$320 in US dollars, and was ranked 171st of 189 countries in 2017 by the human development index (HDI), a composite statistic of life expectancy, education and income per capita indicators (UNDP human development reports). In 2010, 71% of the population was estimated to survive on less than \$1.90 per day (World Bank). Life expectancy at birth in 2017 was 63 years, and though significant progress is being made, neonatal and under-5 mortality remains high at 23 and 55 per 1000 live births, respectively (world bank). The population is largely rural (83% in 2017, World Bank), with a young population (44% under the age of 15, 2017, World Bank) and high fertility rate (4.6, 2016 data, World Bank). Malaria is endemic, and there is an ongoing generalised HIV epidemic: adult HIV prevalance (age 15-49) was estimated to be 9.6% in 2017 (UNAIDS), though falling from a peak of 16.6% in 1999. HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) national scale up began in 2004 and in 2017 71% of elibigible adults and children were estimated to be recieveing ART (UNAIDS). It is classed by the WHO as a high-TB/high-HIV burden country, with an estimated TB incidence rate of 131 (95% CI 70-210) cases per 100000 population per year. 


It has a subtropcial climate, with three main seasons: a warm wet season from November to April, a cooler dry winter period from May to August and a hot dry period from September to October. Blantyre city, the location of the study in this thesis, is the second city of Malawi with a population of 585000. It is located in Blantyre district, population 995000 in 2018 (Malawi ONS), in the Shire highlands at an altitude of 1000m (Figure \@ref(fig:malawi-map)).

### Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital

Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), located in Blantyre city, is the tertiary referral hospital for the Southern Region of Malawi. It has 1300 beds but often operates above capacity, and is the only site providing free inpatient healthcare to the adult population of Blantyre district. Since 2011 it has had a dedicated emergency department for adults, the Adult Emergency and Trauma Centre, staffed 24 hours a day. Since 2015 (and for the whole of the study period), attendees to the AETC must be referred from a primary health clinic. Adults attending the AETC are triaged by a nurse and then reviewed by a doctor or clinical officer; if admission under a specialty team (including medicine) is deemed appropriate then a patient will be reviewed by an intern or registrar from the admitting specialty and usually by a consultant within 24 hours. There is a 6-bed AETC resusitation area in which oxygen concentrators, cardiac monitors and a defibrillator are available; none of these items are available in the rest of the AETC. 

There are two dedicated single-sex medical wards, each of approximately 60 beds, and one mixed-sex TB ward. Male and female high-dependency units (HDUs), each with a capacity of six beds, have oxygen concentrators (or, if available, oxygen cylinders) to deliver supplemental oxygen. The medical wards are staffed by two or three trained nurses and a variable number of nursing students. Basic nursing care is usually provided by a patients relative or friend, called a 'guardian.' Patients on the medical wards are reviewed twice-weekly by a consultant physician and then variably at other times by junior doctors, clinical officers or medical students depending on the availability of staff. Malawi national treatment guidelines suggest ceftriaxone for the treatment of sepsis requiring hospitalisation. 

### Participating Laboratories

#### Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Clinical Research Programme

The Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme was established in 1995 and since them has been active in researching priority health issues in Malawi. It is an affiliate of the Malawi College of Medicine, and is based in the grounds of QECH in Blantyre. It runs an on-site microbiology laboratory which has provided an aerobic blood culture service to QECH since 1998, and also provides CSF microscopy and culture. Bacterial culture is carried out as per British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines and the laboratory adheres to UK NEQAS external quality control. It is core funded by the Wellcome Trust.

#### Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute

The Wellcome Sanger Institute is a research institute based in Hinxton, UK, which was established in 1993, and undertakes research in all aspects of genomics including bacterial genomics as part of the parasite and microbes programme. It has one of the largest DNA sequencing facilities in the world as well as high performace computing clusters. It is funded by the Wellcome Trust.

## Clinical Study

The DASSIM (Developing an Antimicrobial Strategy for Sepsis in Malawi) study was an observational cohort study, recruiting from the AETC at QECH with two broad aims: firstly, to describe the presentation, aetiology and determinents of outcome in sepsis in Malawi; and secondly to determinents of carriage of ESBL-E in sepsis survivors.

### Entry Criteria

The study was open for recruitment between 19 February 2017 and 2 October 2018; there were three arms. Firstly, in order to define the aetiology of sepsis, adults with sepsis attending AETC were recruited as early as possible in their attendance to QECH following triage. Secondly, in order to clearly define the relative effects of antimicrobial exposure versus hospital admission in ESBL-E acquisition and carriage, antibiotic unexposed adults attending AETC with no plan for antimicrobial administration were recruited. Finally, to define baseline flux of ESBL-E antibiotic-unexposed community members were recruited. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for each arm are given shown in Table \@ref(tab:inc-crit). For logistic reasons, recruitment occured 7am - 5pm Monday to Friday. 

Exlclusion criteria were the same for all arms of the study: Particiapnts were not eligible for enrollment if they were unable to give informed consent and no guardian available to provide proxy consent; they spoke neither English nor Chichewa; or they lived > 30km from Blantyre city. The antibiotic-unexposed inpatients and community members were matched on age (+/- 5yr) and sex to sepsis survivors (defined as patients surviving to 28 days). In addition community members were matched on location to sepsis survivors; putative households for recruitment were identified by random walk from the houses of surviving sepsis participants, with initial direction established by spinning a bottle on the floor.

### Study Visits and Patient Sampling

#### Enrollment assessment and first six hours

An overview of the study visit schedule is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:study-sampl-flow-diag). At enrollment, following consent a baseline questionnaire was completed (by the guardian if the participant was obtunded) to capture background demographic and clinical data, a Chichewa-language EQ-5D heath related quality of life questionairre completed, and sample collection undertaken (see below). For hospitalised patients, enrollment aimed to be as soon after triage as possible, and arm 1 (sepsis) patients underwent a more intensive assessment over the first six hours of enrollment. Data on therapies administered over this time period were captured by hourly review by a member of the study team, including the time of administration of  antimicrobial therapy and volumes of intravenous fluid administered, the latter visually comfirmed by the study team member. Hourly vital signs and standardised bedside assessment of intravascular status were performed: central capillary refill, limb temperature and passive leg raise. For this latter test, blood pressure and pulse rate were measured with the participant sitting at 45 degrees, and one minute after lying the participant supine and lifting the legs to 45 degrees. All blood pressure mesurements were made noninvasively with an automated cuff (Omron, Japan), and oxygen saturations measured with a deadicate study pulse oximeter (Contec Medical Systems, China).

All treatment decisions were at the discretion of the parrticipant's attending healthcare worker.

#### Subsequent visits

Hospitalised participants were briefly reviewed daily Monday to Friday following admission whilst on the wards to capture details of therapies administered. For the 72 hours following admission, vital signs were repeated and an assessment made of intravenous fluid administered; if records of fluid balance were incomplete (as wa anticipated to be the case in the majority of cases) then fluid administered was estimated from participant- or guardian-reported number of bags of fluid administered.

The visit schedule for the study is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:study-sampl-flow-diag). Arm 1 (sepsis) and 2 (hospital inpatients) were reviewed by a study team member 7 and 28 days following enrollment, and at 3 and 6 months; comunity members were reviewed at 28 days and 6 months. At each visit, details of any antimicrobials or other therapies recieved and any health care facility contact were collected, and the Chichewa language EQ-5D was repeated. Samples were collected as below. 

#### Blood, urine, sputum, and stool collection 

Blood was collected from arm 1 (sepsis) participants only on enrollment and at the 4-week visit. At baseline, blood was collected aseptically directly into collection tubes with a vacutainer device with the following order of draw and volumes: one BD BACTEC aerobic blood culture bottle (7-10ml), one BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic mycobacterial culture bottle (3-5ml) (Beckton Dickinson, United States), one serum (10ml) and two EDTA (4ml, both Grenier Bio-One, Austria) samples. Finger prick for capillary blood was used to deterimine capillary lactate (Lactate Pro 2, Arkray, Japan), to test for _P. falciparum_ HRP-2 antigen (Paracheck Pf, Orchid Biomedical, India) and, if HIV status was unknown, to test for HIV antibodies with rapid diagnostic tests following Malwian national guidelines(ref). At the 4-week visit, 10mls of convalescent serum was collected. At baseline, urine was collected from all arm 1 (sepsis) participants into a sterile polypropylene universal container (Alpha Laboratories, UK) either by the participant themselves (if this was possible) or with the aid of a disposable bedpan.

At the enrollment visit and all other visits for all arms of the study stool was collected into a sterile polypropylene universal container (Alpha Laboratories, UK) with aseptic technique. If it was not possible for a patient to provide stool then a rectal swab was taken using a sterile rayon-tipped swab (Technical Service Consultants Ltd, UK) inserted into 2-3cm into the rectum, rotated for approximately 10 seconds and placed into Amies gel media for transport to the laboratory.

The decision to collect sputum for Xpert tetsing for tuberculosis rested with the participant's attending healthcare worker. Sputum samples were collected in sterile polypropylene universal container and trasported to the laboratory for analysis.

#### Imaging: chest x-ray and ultrasound scanning

Ultrasound examination following the FASH (Focussed ASsessment for HIV-associated tuberculosis) protocol(ref) was undertaken for all sepsis participants by me, following training with a UK-registered consultant radiologist. The protocol aims to ascertain presence or absence of six features likely to be associated with extrapulmonary TB: pericardial effusion, abdominal lymph nodes, pleural effusion, ascites, hypoechoic focal liver lesions or hypoechoic focal splenic lesions. Scanning was undertaken with a xxxxxx device with a curvilinear probe; images were saved and 10% of scans were read by a UK-registered consultant radiologist for quality control.

Decision to undertake chest x-ray was at the discretion of the participant's attending healthcare worker. If chest x-ray was done then digital pictures were taken and stored in the study database.
