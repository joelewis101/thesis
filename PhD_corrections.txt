Page 35, Table: Ssekitoleko 2011 (1) Numbers n=96 or 418?
The Ssekitoleko (1) paper includes participants from Jacob 2012 and 96 new participants - the proportion of male participants and proportion with HIV is only presented for the whole cohort (n = 418) but outcome data can be extracted for the n=96 new participants. I have added a footnote to the table to clarify this.
