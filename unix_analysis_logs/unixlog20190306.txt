Woooo quast and checkm have run

import and look at stats

The other job for today is to collate a list of the genomes that will be context for the tree

See /Users/joelewis/Documents/joe_macbook_backup2019/Sanger/DASSIM2/read_screen/bracken_on_reads.html for details of QC

Three groups - 1) not esco 2) assemblies failed 3) contaminated

run metabat on group 3 and see how it gets on

bash ~/scripts/run_metabat2.sh DASSIM2_contam_contigs.txt /lustre/scratch118/infgen/team216/jl25/DASSIM2/denovoassembly/20190305/assemblyfind_5510 /lustre/scratch118/infgen/team216/jl25/DASSIM2/reads/pathfind_5510

**I THINK MATâ€™S SCRIPT HAS AN ERROR - ONLY EVER GET ONE BIN ***
**** GAAAAAAAAAH ***

Modified it - is a path thing maybe?
