# The mystery of the non running kraken/bracken files


There are 708 fastqs in DASSIM 2 = 354 samples

Only 353 bracken samples in kraken_ouput

1 failed to run - and that stopped the nice summary being made

Let’s get the code the kraken script uses and run it

It’s python ~avt/Scripts/run_kraken/bin/kraken_parser.py 

Throws a bunch of awk broken pipe errors but on checking these were in the dASSIM 1 log files too

Spits out the .tsv we want

woo 

The one that did;t run

cut -f 1 Bracken_species_composition.tsv > bracken_files_run_successfully.txt
ls | grep -f bracken_files_run_successfully.txt -v

is 

28099_2#16_1.fastq.gz 

Now check QC stats

pf data --type study --id 5510 --stats

generates

5510.pathfind_stats.csv

Then let’s play woop
