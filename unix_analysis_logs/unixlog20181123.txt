Looked at checkM and quast output - some assemblies seem contaminatedKraken thinks they are all escos
Mat has suggested running metaBat

In the meantime run prokka on the others to annotate

./submit_prokka.sh assemblies_for_prokka.txt

first one ran was 26141_1#153.contigs_spades.fa
check dat schizzle!

Metabat script is as per mat

~mb29/bsub_scripts/run_MetaBat_on_contaminated_contigs.sh
