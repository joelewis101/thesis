So looks like metabat worked for 2 samples

run quast and checkm on both

bsub.py --threads 12 32 checkm ~mb29/bsub_scripts/checkm.sh /lustre/scratch118/infgen/team216/jl25/DASSIM2/denovoassembly/20190305/assemblyfind_5510/28099_2#52.metabat/28099_2#52.metabat/

~/scripts/submit_quast2.sh /lustre/scratch118/infgen/team216/jl25/DASSIM2/denovoassembly/20190305/assemblyfind_5510/28099_2#52.metabat/28099_2#52.metabat

~/scripts/submit_quast2.sh /lustre/scratch118/infgen/team216/jl25/DASSIM2/denovoassembly/20190305/assemblyfind_5510/28099_1#276.metabat/28099_1#276.metabat/

One of them has only 1 contig in the second bin
The other looks like it has worked

Leave for now and talk this over with mat
