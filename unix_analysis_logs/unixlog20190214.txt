# woooooo DASSIM 2 data

set spades going 

bacteria_assembly_and_annotation -t study -i 5510 -assembler spades 

and

~avt/Scripts/run_kraken/run_kraken.py -f read_filenames_1.txt -o kraken  

I think QC runs automatically like once the reads hit the drive - let's wait and see


### also - I'm still worried about misclassification of cd-hit-est

try using accurate mode 

# id different but DAS1096U still doesnt have one single thing
I think I need to do ariba or SRST2 to see for sure - but this will take ages
# leave it till my kraken jobs are donr

# for now - look at CTXM-27
