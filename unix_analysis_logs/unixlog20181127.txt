OK, so:

I looked at the contaminated contigs after runnig metabat
N50 increases in all cases - this is because mat’s metabat script ditches small comntigs
In all cases, coverage AND contamination decrease,  - is this also just a small contig effect?

Regardless, two questions:

1) Why is this happening? I guess 2 x ESCOs in one sample? CHeck for heterozygosity in these samples

2) What do we do with these samples - they can’t go into a core genome phylogeny cos will mess up Roary

So, plan:

1) Check these samples for heterozygosity
2) Roary on annotations *excluding* these samples and build a core genome phylogeny
3) Make a multiple alignment file and tree using maps to reference - will need to run Gubbins first to account for recombination

*** Script records

pf snp --type file --id ESCO_lanes.txt -p 

To make the multiple alignment

Gubbins

bsub -q normal -M8000 -R "select[mem>8000] rusage[mem=8000]" -n16 -R "span[hosts=1]"  'run_gubbins.py --threads 16 ESCO_lanes.txt_Escherichia_coli_str_K-12_substr_MG1655_v3_concatenated.aln'

It seems that some of the annotations didn’t work for some reason - and I messed up the log files so don’t know why.

Rerun the annotations for those that failed with proper logfiles this time
